Visual Audiolization is the process of creating sound or music from a visual source. This project creates pixelated artwork, with over 3,600,000 different combinations, and maps each pixel to a beat on a drum. This beat is then played back to the user, and they are able to literally listen to the artwork that they are looking at. The user has the option to choose between 3 color schemes, and allows for a custom user experience every time the program is run.
